# Ohm Guru
Calculate resistor value based on its color code. Made using flutter framework. Made during internship.

Either input the resistor value and get the color code or input the color code and get the resistor value.
Works for 4, 5 or 6 band resistors.

Inspired by digikey's tool [https://www.digikey.com/en/resources/conversion-calculators/conversion-calculator-resistor-color-code]; some edge case logic errors in the original are fixed in this implementation.

## UI Sample

> 4 Band with color code

> 4 Band with resistor value

![](./readme-files/5%20band%20with%20colour%20code.png)
> 5 Band with color code

![](./readme-files/5%20band%20with%20resistor%20value.png)
> 5 Band with resistor value

![](./readme-files/6%20band%20with%20colour%20code.png)
> 6 Band with color code


## Comments
- Well commented codebase imo.
- Need to reimplement the dynamic resistor image
